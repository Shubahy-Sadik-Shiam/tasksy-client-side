# Tasksy

Tasksy is a task management application that helps users organize, track, and update their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create tasks, categorize them (e.g., To-Do, In-Progress, Done), and update them as they progress. The app also integrates authentication, likely with Google Login, and uses a backend (possibly built with Express and MongoDB) to store and manage tasks.
